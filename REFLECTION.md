What part of the code was most confusing and why?

The most confusing part was understanding how setInterval keeps running by itself. It only stops when clearInterval is called.

How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?

The animation shows how the page updates over time without stopping everything and each update happens independently every 500ms.

What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?

I added a background color change during the loading process. It made the animation more dynamic and helped show that something was actually happening.
